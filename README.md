Decentralized BnB (initial release proof-of-concept)

This is a decentralized BnB (Bed and Breakfast) DApp smart contract. This allows direct payment transaction using cryptocurrency (ETH) to settle rentals. 

There are 2 parties involved:

1. Renter - The user who will rent a property.
2. Owner - The property owner who will accept payment.

Rather than centralized services that connect renters with owners, this application allows renters to directly connect with the owner of 
a rental property and settle a transaction using ether or ETH. 

The requirement is having access to the DApp, no need for other software. Settlement of payment will be on the Ethereum blockchain, and can
be verified from a blockchain explorer (e.g. Etherscan).
